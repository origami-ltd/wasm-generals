# GeneralsX - Cross-Platform Command & Conquer: Generals

A community-driven cross-platform port of Command & Conquer: Generals and Zero Hour, enabling the classic RTS to run natively on **Linux, macOS, and Windows** under a single modern codebase: **SDL3** (windowing/input) + **DXVK** (DirectX 8 → Vulkan graphics) + **OpenAL** (audio) + **64-bit**.

**Current Status**: Linux native builds functional (Phase 1 complete). macOS ARM64 native builds functional (Phase 1 complete, DXVK + MoltenVK working). Audio (Phase 2) in progress on both platforms.

## Project Goals

This repository targets a **single codebase** that builds and runs on all three major desktop platforms, replacing the original Windows-only DirectX 8 / Miles Sound System stack with portable open-source equivalents.

### 🌍 Cross-Platform Vision

This project transforms the Windows-exclusive Command & Conquer: Generals into a truly cross-platform game:

- **🐧 Linux Native Support** - **IN PROGRESS** - Native builds via Docker with DXVK + SDL3
- **🪟 Windows Enhanced** - **IN PROGRESS** - Win64 builds using DXVK + sdl3
- **🍎 macOS Native Support** - **IN PROGRESS** - ARM64 native builds working (DXVK + MoltenVK)
- **🎮 Modern Graphics** - DXVK translates DirectX 8 → Vulkan for native Linux rendering
- **🔧 Modern Architecture** - SDL3 windowing/input, portable INI configuration

### 🎮 Features

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**:

- **Single codebase** for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Linux native builds** via Docker or native GCC/Clang (SDL3 + DXVK)
- **Windows modern builds** 64bit binaries & MSVC2022 preset
- **macOS in progress** via DXVK + MoltenVK (Vulkan → Metal) -- ARM64 native builds working
- Unified configuration system via INI files (replacing Windows Registry)
- Platform-native file system integration
- **No Wine/Proton required** - Native DirectX → Vulkan translation via DXVK

**Graphics Enhancements**:

- **DXVK** - Native DirectX 8 → Vulkan translation layer
- **SDL3** for cross-platform window management and input handling
- Improved texture loading and memory management
- Enhanced graphics debugging and profiling tools
- Modern GPU compatibility via Vulkan backend

**Modern Development**:

- Updated from Visual C++ 6.0 to modern C++20 standards
- CMake build system for consistent cross-platform builds
- Comprehensive development documentation and phase tracking
- Automated builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux

## 🔨 Building from Source

### Linux - ✅ Primary Focus

Native ELF builds with DXVK + SDL3. Graphics working, audio in progress.

**[📖 Linux Build Guide](docs/ETC/LINUX_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)**

```bash
# Clone and build with Docker
git clone https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsX.git
cd GeneralsX
./scripts/docker-build-linux-zh.sh linux64-deploy

# Or build natively on Linux
cmake --preset linux64-deploy
cmake --build build/linux64-deploy --target z_generals
```

### Windows (Modern SDL3/DXVK)

Modern 64-bit Windows build using the same SDL3 + DXVK + OpenAL stack. Separate branch - **In Progress**

### macOS (Apple Silicon)

Native ARM64 builds working via DXVK + MoltenVK. Audio is not yet.
The game engine initializes with a lot of dxvk+moltenvk related bugs.

**[📖 macOS Build Guide](docs/ETC/MACOS_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)**

Quick start:
```bash
# Install prerequisites once: brew install cmake ninja meson
# + LunarG Vulkan SDK: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#mac
git clone https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsX.git
cd GeneralsX
./scripts/build-macos-zh.sh
./scripts/deploy-macos-zh.sh
./scripts/run-macos-zh.sh -win
```

### 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

For documented limitations and known bugs, check the development diary in [docs/DEV_BLOG/](docs/DEV_BLOG/).

### ⚙️ Build Requirements

The repository uses a vcpkg manifest (`vcpkg.json`) paired with a lockfile (`vcpkg-lock.json`). Key dependencies:

- **SDL3** - Cross-platform windowing and input handling (all platforms)
- **DXVK** - DirectX 8 → Vulkan translation layer (all platforms)
- **Vulkan SDK** - Modern graphics rendering backend
- **OpenAL** - Cross-platform audio system (replacing Miles Sound System)
- **CMake** - Build system with per-platform presets

For dependency management details, see [vcpkg.json](vcpkg.json).

**Approach**: Single codebase, SDL3 + DXVK + OpenAL on all platforms. Native Vulkan, NOT Wine emulation.

See [docs/DEV_BLOG/](docs/DEV_BLOG/) and [docs/WORKDIR/phases/](docs/WORKDIR/phases/) for detailed phase progress.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### 🧵 Multithreading Modernization

Future initiative to leverage multi-core CPUs while preserving deterministic gameplay. High-level plan:

- Start with low-risk tasks (parallel asset/INI loading, background audio/I/O)
- Evolve to moderate threading (AI batches, object updates with partitioning)
- Consider advanced loop decoupling (producer–consumer) once stable
